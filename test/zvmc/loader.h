/**
 * Dynamically loads the ZVMC module with a VM implementation.
 *
 * This function tries to open a dynamically loaded library (DLL) at the given `filename`.
 * On UNIX-like systems dlopen() function is used. On Windows LoadLibrary() function is used.
 *
 * If the file does not exist or is not a valid shared library the ::ZVMC_LOADER_CANNOT_OPEN error
 * code is signaled and NULL is returned.
 *
 * After the DLL is successfully loaded the function tries to find the ZVM create function in the
 * library. The `filename` is used to guess the ZVM name and the name of the create function.
 * The create function name is constructed by the following rules. Consider example path:
 * "/ethereum/libexample-interpreter.so.1.0".
 * - the filename is taken from the path:
 *   "libexample-interpreter.so.1.0",
 * - the "lib" prefix and all file extensions are stripped from the name:
 *   "example-interpreter"
 * - all "-" are replaced with "_" to construct _base name_:
 *   "example_interpreter",
 * - the function name "zvmc_create_" + _base name_ is searched in the library:
 *   "zvmc_create_example_interpreter",
 * - if the function is not found, the function name "zvmc_create" is searched in the library.
 *
 * If the create function is found in the library, the pointer to the function is returned.
 * Otherwise, the ::ZVMC_LOADER_SYMBOL_NOT_FOUND error code is signaled and NULL is returned.
 *
 * It is safe to call this function with the same filename argument multiple times
 * (the DLL is not going to be loaded multiple times).
 *
 * @param filename    The null terminated path (absolute or relative) to an ZVMC module
 *                    (dynamically loaded library) containing the VM implementation.
 *                    If the value is NULL, an empty C-string or longer than the path maximum length
 *                    the ::ZVMC_LOADER_INVALID_ARGUMENT is signaled.
 * @param error_code  The pointer to the error code. If not NULL the value is set to
 *                    ::ZVMC_LOADER_SUCCESS on success or any other error code as described above.
 * @return            The pointer to the ZVM create function or NULL in case of error.

/**
 * Dynamically loads the ZVMC module, then creates and configures the VM instance.
 *
 * This function performs the following actions atomically:
 * - loads the ZVMC module (as zvmc_load()),
 * - creates the VM instance,
 * - configures the VM instance with options provided in the @p config parameter.
 *
 * The configuration string (@p config) has the following syntax:
 *
 *     <path> ("," <option-name> ["=" <option-value>])*
 *
 * In this syntax, an option without a value can be specified (`,option,`)
 * as a shortcut for using empty value (`,option=,`).
 *
 * Options are passed to a VM in the order they are specified in the configuration string.
 * It is up to the VM implementation how to handle duplicated options and other conflicts.
 *
 * Example configuration string:
 *
 *     ./modules/vm.so,engine=compiler,trace,verbosity=2
 *
 * The function signals the same errors as zvmc_load_and_create() and additionally:
 * - ::ZVMC_LOADER_INVALID_OPTION_NAME
 *   when the provided options list contains an option unknown for the VM,
 * - ::ZVMC_LOADER_INVALID_OPTION_VALUE
 *   when there exists unsupported value for a given VM option.

 *
 * @param config      The path to the ZVMC module with additional configuration options.
 * @param error_code  The pointer to the error code. If not NULL the value is set to
 *                    ::ZVMC_LOADER_SUCCESS on success or any other error code as described above.
 * @return            The pointer to the created VM or NULL in case of error.
